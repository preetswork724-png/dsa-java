/**
 * Problem:
 * <Floor in a Sorted Array>
 *
 * Link:
 * <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/floor-in-a-sorted-array-1587115620/1>
 *
 * Pattern:
 * <Core Binary Search>
 *
 * Brute Force Intuition:
 * - Linearly traverse the array and check for the largest element lesser than or equal to x.
 *
 * - Why it is inefficient?
 * - Brute force requires O(N) time to find the floor for a single value.
 * - When the array is large or when many queries are performed, the total time becomes O(Q * N).
 * - Inefficient compared to O(Q * log N) using binary search.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(N)
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(1)
 *
 * Better and Optimal Approach (Used Below):
 * - Since the array is sorted, apply Binary search to directly locate the floor.
 * - Maintain a candidate answer and shrink the search space accordingly.
 * - If the element at the middle is greater than x, then all the elements further to the right will always be greater.
 * - Therefore, shrink from right.
 * - If the element at the middle is lesser than or equal to x, store the potential candidate and try to maximize the answer.
 * - Therefore, shrink from left.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(log N)
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(1)
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Do not return mid directly, remember to maximize the answer.
